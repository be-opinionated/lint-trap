# lint-trap
CI actions to automatically fix linting issues

## Concept

This project is a place for actions and workflows for various CI systems
specifically for automatically fixing linting issues. It's not meant to do
any of that fixing itself, but rather install and run the appropriate tools
to do so for the user and commit those changes back into the repository.

## Development

This is in very early development. If you want to use it, make sure you
get from a specific commit.
